 * What the signed-in administrator may do **in the active community**.
 *
 * Both halves come from state rather than from a seeded record: the role is the one the membership
 * carries for this community, and the identity is the administrator account. That is what makes the
 * switcher real — the same person can be a Super Admin in one community and a Finance Officer in
 * another, and the navigation, the pages and the action buttons follow the role they hold there.
 *
 * This is a usability boundary, never a security one: the backend re-authorises every request
 * against the authenticated session.
